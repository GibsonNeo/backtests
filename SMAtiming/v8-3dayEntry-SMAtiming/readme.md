Ai just told me my whole system logic was flawed: basically it was saying the zero day I have been using was always set to be closed.  I just dont understand how thats possible.  But this new system its now corrected to 1 and 2 exit.  So basically a close below SMA happens, then the next day we get out (that is 1 day) on a 2 day we wait 1 more additional day to see if that day also closes below SMA, if so we exit on the next day after that 1 day waiting period, so we call this 2 exit.
